# CPU-SCHEDULING-PROGRAMS-OS
Collection of C programs implementing various CPU Scheduling Algorithms.   I am adding one scheduling program daily â€” including FCFS, SJF, SRTF, Round Robin, and Priority (preemptive &amp; non-preemptive).   Each program is simple, beginner-friendly, and ready for lab practice or exams.
